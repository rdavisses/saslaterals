    int timeout:            number of seconds used to evaluate a stalled system. If process status has not changed in this amount of time, 
                            consider it process locked / broken
    str itype:              instrument type to be monitored. Can be one of {all, ir, uv, ra}. In most cases, leave as default of all. In the 
                            future, can be used to split the process amongst multiple control instruments
    str address:            Must match the listening address of the nuWave instance (see Advanced->Server Settings from nuWave homepage menu bar)
                            Default value presented here is the default value for nuWave to serve
    int port:               Must match the listening port fo the nuWave instance (see Advanced->Server Settings from nuWave homepage menu bar)
                            Default value presented here is the default value for nuWave to serve
    int warningDuration:    Duration the Warning UI Dialog will display prior to returning to your calling function. This dictates the length of 
                            time in seconds that the user will have to cancel the operation 
    int socketTO:           Length of time (seconds) reserved to try and connect to the NuWave instance. This will fail if there is no nuWave instance
                            available (and the RETCODES::NotOpened status will be returned). 5 seconds (default) should be the MINIMUM length of time 
                            as the connection can be slow based upon system status.
